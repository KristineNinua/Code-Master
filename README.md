# Code-Master
A mid-sized online learning platform Code Master wants to improve its reporting system by organizing its operational data into a structured database. 
The platform offers various courses, taught by different instructors, and taken by multiple students

Each student can enroll in multiple courses. A student’s enrollment must track the enrollment date, status (e.g., "active", "completed", "dropped"), and final grade. 
Students can also submit course reviews after completing a course, which include a rating (1–5), optional written feedback, and a submission date

Instructors may teach more than one course, and each course is taught by exactly one instructor. 
Courses have attributes such as a title, description, category (e.g., Data Science, Design, Marketing), duration in hours, and level (e.g., Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)

The platform tracks lessons inside each course. Each lesson belongs to one course and includes a title, type (video, reading, quiz), and estimated duration.

The company also wants to store subscription data for each student, tracking the start and end dates, payment amount, and subscription status. 

Finally, the platform wants to track instructor payouts, including payment amount, date, and associated course. Each payout is linked to both an instructor and a course.
